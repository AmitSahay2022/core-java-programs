(Q1) Introduce Yourself?<br>
      My name is amit kumar and i have 5 years of experience in java programming, Spring boot. <br>
(Q2) What features of core java you have used in your project?<br>
      OOPS, Exception Handling, Collections, Lambda, Streams<br>
(Q3) What is Oops?
     Object oriented Programming --> while writting code if we think about objects than it is object oriented<br>
     it has 4 features <br>
     (a) Abstraction-> Hide internal details/complexity and expose only functionality <br>
     (b) Encapsulation-> keep all the data private and provide getter/setter to access it <br>
     (c) Inheritance-> one entity can inherit property or behaviour from other entity <br>
     (d) Polymorphism-> Acchieving different functionality or behaviour. method overloading/overriding <br>
(Q4) Why ByteCode? <br>
     It is a varified code, not humen readable hence can be freely distributed without exposing our code <br>
     can run on any JVM. Note JVM is Machine dependent and it convert .class file to machine code.<br> 
(Q5) Why Java?
     It is portable (write once than run on any machine which has JVM)<br>
     It is secure because it runs on vertual machine. <br>
     It is Object Oriented and after JDK 1.8 it also supports Functional programming <br>
     It is robust (because of strong memory management,type checking, exception handling) hence prevent system crash<br>
           and improve performance<br> in java there is no chance of actual system crash only JVM can crash<br>
