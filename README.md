     Object oriented Programming --> while writting code if we think about objects than it is object oriented<br>
     it has 4 features <br>
     (a) Abstraction-> Hide internal details/complexity and expose only functionality <br>
     (b) Encapsulation-> keep all the data private and provide getter/setter to access it <br>

     (d) Polymorphism-> Acchieving different functionality or behaviour. method overloading/overriding <br>
